# Production Deployment Plan

This document outlines the steps to deploy your Event Ticketing DApp to production on the Ethereum mainnet.

## Prerequisites

1. **Ethereum Mainnet ETH**:
   - You'll need real ETH for deployment and gas fees
   - Ensure you have at least 0.5 ETH for deployment and initial operations

2. **Production RPC Provider**:
   - Sign up for a paid plan with Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode
   - Production applications need reliable, high-performance RPC endpoints

3. **Security Audit**:
   - Consider hiring a professional security firm to audit your contracts
   - At minimum, use tools like Slither, Mythril, or MythX

4. **Multi-signature Wallet**:
   - Set up a multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe) for contract ownership
   - This provides better security than a single private key

## Smart Contract Preparation

1. **Finalize Contract Code**:
   - Remove any test-specific code
   - Ensure all functions are properly tested
   - Implement proper access controls

2. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Review all functions for gas efficiency
   - Consider implementing more batch operations
   - Use fixed-size arrays where possible

3. **Upgradeability**:
   - Consider implementing a proxy pattern for future upgrades
   - Options include OpenZeppelin's Transparent Proxy or UUPS Proxy

4. **Emergency Functions**:
   - Implement emergency pause functionality
   - Add circuit breakers for critical functions

## Deployment Process

1. **Testnet Rehearsal**:
   - Deploy the final contract to Goerli or Sepolia
   - Test all functionality thoroughly
   - Verify the contract on Etherscan

2. **Mainnet Deployment**:
   - Update hardhat.config.js with mainnet settings:
   ```javascript
   mainnet: {
     url: process.env.MAINNET_RPC_URL,
     accounts: [process.env.PRODUCTION_PRIVATE_KEY],
     gasPrice: 30000000000, // 30 gwei
     timeout: 1000000
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
   ```

4. **Verify Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "EventTicketNFT" "ETT" 1000 1753939200 OWNER_ADDRESS
   ```

5. **Transfer Ownership**:
   - Transfer contract ownership to the multi-signature wallet
   - Verify ownership has been transferred

## Frontend Deployment

1. **Update Contract Addresses**:
   - Update the frontend code with mainnet contract addresses
   - Add mainnet configuration to the network settings

2. **Web Hosting**:
   - Deploy the frontend to a decentralized hosting service:
     - IPFS via Pinata, Infura, or Fleek
     - Arweave for permanent storage
   - Alternatively, use traditional web hosting:
     - Vercel, Netlify, or AWS

3. **Domain Setup**:
   - Register a domain name
   - Set up DNS to point to your hosting
   - Consider using ENS for a .eth domain

4. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Ensure your site has HTTPS enabled
   - Most hosting providers handle this automatically

## Post-Deployment

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for contract events
   - Use tools like Tenderly or Defender for alerts

2. **Analytics**:
   - Implement analytics to track usage
   - Consider both on-chain and off-chain analytics

3. **Support System**:
   - Create a support channel (Discord, Telegram, etc.)
   - Document common issues and solutions

4. **Marketing**:
   - Announce your launch on social media
   - Consider partnerships with event organizers

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Layer 2 Solutions**:
   - Consider deploying to Layer 2 solutions for lower fees:
     - Optimism
     - Arbitrum
     - Polygon

2. **Gas Price Management**:
   - Implement dynamic gas pricing
   - Consider subsidizing gas for users

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - Use batch operations for administrative functions
   - Implement meta-transactions for better UX

## Legal Considerations

1. **Terms of Service**:
   - Create clear terms of service
   - Outline ticket transfer policies

2. **Privacy Policy**:
   - Implement a privacy policy
   - Ensure GDPR compliance if applicable

3. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Research ticket resale regulations in your target markets
   - Ensure compliance with local laws

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Contract State Backup**:
   - Regularly backup important contract state
   - Document recovery procedures

2. **Frontend Backup**:
   - Maintain backups of frontend code
   - Use version control (GitHub, GitLab)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document all deployment steps
   - Create a disaster recovery plan

## Maintenance Plan

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Schedule regular maintenance windows
   - Communicate updates to users

2. **Security Patches**:
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Have a plan for emergency fixes

3. **Feature Roadmap**:
   - Maintain a public roadmap
   - Gather user feedback for improvements
